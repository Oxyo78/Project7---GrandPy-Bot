# Project7 - GrandPy-Bot

Hello this is **GrandPy Bot** ! deploy me on a server and ask an postal adress, I will tell you the story about it.
I'm programmed in Python with the Flask framework and using the **Google Map API** and **Media Wiki API**.
Do you want to hear a story about a street ?


----------


First time to hear me ? Install the library.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a "config.py" file at the root of the folder and add your Google API key like GOOGLE_APP_ID ='YourKey'

To run this web app, tape this command :

    py run.py
